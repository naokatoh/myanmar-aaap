A police officer was seen holding a BA-94 or BA-93 sub-machine gun similar to a Burmese-made Uzi. Attempts were made to remove the bullet that struck Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing in the head, but doctors surrendered on the morning of February 12, 2021. A doctor at Nay Pyi Taw Hospital who treated her said the bullet had penetrated her head. Most of her brain function is out of order. The wound was caused by a live bullet. The bullet pierced the back of the right ear and landed on the left side of the head. He was medically diagnosed with brain death.According to a photo of her motorcycle helmet hit by a bullet, the bullet appeared to have pierced the helmet and could not have been a rubber bullet. Forensic experts have speculated that the bullet may have been a real bullet. She also concluded that the shape of her fall had been a direct hit, not a recurrence.On February 15, the family agreed to remove the breathing tube and transport the body, but the junta verbally pressured them to delay as much as they could.
