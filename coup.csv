Attempts were made to remove the bullet that struck Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing in the head, but doctors surrendered on the morning of February 12, 2021.

The bullet pierced the back of the right ear and landed on the left side of the head. He was medically diagnosed with brain death.According to a photo of her motorcycle helmet hit by a bullet, the bullet appeared to have pierced the helmet and could not have been a rubber bullet.
